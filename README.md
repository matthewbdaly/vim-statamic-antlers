Vim syntax highlighting for Statamic Antlers templates

Please note the following:

* This is the first time I've written a syntax highlighter for Vim, so don't be surprised if it's not very good
* So far, it's based *heavily* on the [Blade highlighter](https://github.com/jwalton512/vim-blade) and extends the PHP and HTML highlighters, which seems to cover *most* of the required functionality adequately
* It's still very much a work in progress
